/*
This function is the core part of calculating sinh and cosh using CORDIC.
Please complete this function to calculate the result of sinh(z0) and cosh(z0)!

Input:
	x0, y0: initial values for the CORDIC process
	z0	  : input angle for your sinh or cosh output
Output: (Note that in HLS, we don't use "return" as this is not supported by HLS)
	sinh_out: output result of sinh(z0)
	cosh_out: output result of cosh(z0)

Hint:
	Take a look at page 25-28 in the following powerpoint link:

*/

	// IMPORTANT: In our testbench, we set x0 = 1, y0 = 0!
	// You can also use different settings, just change the input of the function in testbench
